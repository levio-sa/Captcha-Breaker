# Captcha-Breaker
A Chrome Extension for breaking Captcha

Currently breaks only Moodle Captcha

However, successfully created backend image processor that are able to predict the Captcha from .pmg image stored in a folder for both the Kerberos and Webmail captchas. Will integrate into the extension later.
